# What's next

# cache newly created vertices in gen_more
    # Potentially create better spheres, but certainly less cpu/gpu strain

# get shaders from the web, for autoreload
    # Makes debugging shaders easier

# let buffers be manipulated with mpsc's
    - Setup camera object
        - Setup eventhandelers from js to rust
            - Done working flying camera
# idem with rendering context I guess?
