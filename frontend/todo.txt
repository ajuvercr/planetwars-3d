# What's next

# cache newly created vertices in gen_more
    # Potentially create better spheres, but certainly less cpu/gpu strain

# get shaders from the web, for autoreload
    # Makes debugging shaders easier

# let buffers be manipulated with mpsc's
    # Setup camera object
        # Setup eventhandelers from js to rust
            # Done working flying camera
# idem with rendering context I guess?


There are still some issues with the camera, but it should be more clear when lighting and such is added, so you can play in a cube.

- Add extra flying mechanics, like boosts etc.
- Do what we actually wanted todo and generate planets on the GPU.
- Generic settings menu please?
